## Stored vector
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

## Confirmation that the vector was stored successfully

## First run of myMean function
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}

myMean(assignment2)
# Error code 1: Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'assignment' not found

## The initial function failed because the variable "assignment" does not exist. I changed the variable name to reflect the assignment2 object that was created intitially.

myMean <- function(assignment2) {
+     return(sum(assignment2) / length(someData))
+ }
 
View(myMean)
myMean(assignment2)
# Error code 2: Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'someData' not found

## The second function failed because the variable "someData" does not exist. I changed the variable name to reflect the assignment2 object that was created intitially.


## Corrected version of myMean
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
+     return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))
+ }

View(myMean)
myMean(assignment2)
